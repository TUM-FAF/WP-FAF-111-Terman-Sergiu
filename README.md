###What I've Done

In this laboratory work I created a basic window window with 2 buttons 2 edit boxes and 2 texts. I followed the mandatory points. And also I've added some interaction between the elements. 
1. When the button "Add Food" is presed the text is inputed in the bigger Edit Box
2. At every adding the "Number" status is incremented with one so the user knows how many items he have added
3. When button "Funny" is pressed
