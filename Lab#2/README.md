In this laboratory work I've Added a list box where my elements are imputed. Also added some actions to the listbox
- double click will delete the element
- add elements in listbox when press button add food
- presing CTR+F1 will clear the list
I alse adde a menu
1. Exits the program
2. Pops up a dialog box with a little bit of information about the program
3. Change the Font Color of the string "Food List"

There are also some scroll bars:
- the one from the right changes the background color for the string "Food LIst"
- the bars from the bottom handles the windows size
- also if CTR+SPACE is pressed the the scrollBar from the right is reseted.

There is also an icon and hte Hand arrow is setted for the client Area

## Conclusion
The lab a little bit harder. The most complicated part were the scroll Bars. But if you start to get the hang of it, it becomes preatty easy in the end.
