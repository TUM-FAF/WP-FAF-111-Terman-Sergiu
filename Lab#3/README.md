- Bitmap image
- Bezier curve

## Application Creation Steps
First of all I've sketched my laboratory work on a paper. Designed all the buttons elements to controll the drawing. After that I've added the elments. Then I've setted their functionality step by step. And in the end I've Added the properties to draw stuff.

## What I've used
- I've used the brushes
- Rectangle function
- Elipse function
- PolyBezier function
- Simple line funtctions

The process of drawing is done only in the specifiend are. The program forbids you to draw in other place. Also you have the oportunity to select the color. and the thickness of the line. And you can draw objects filled with color or with background color.

## Conclusion
This lab was pretty easy as long as you know what you want to do. I've concluded that in order to make something you have to sketch the work, create a list of tasks and follow them step by step. In the end to make something to draw was pretty fun. Even if sometimes was a pain with the drawing bugs.
